# FAQ

## Is this safe to use in a mature mining rig.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
No.

Not yet anyway. It's rather early to use it properly. Untill it's seen some actual use, I can't give you a guarentee.
But I can say it hasn't crashed yet. I'm hoping it's a good sign (and not a catastrophe going to happen.)

## I try to download blocks and the thing stops working! Why?

After the wallet downloads the blocks, the wallet restarts itself which tells docker it's stopped.
I currently don't have a fix for that. My suggestion is to not use that option for now.
At some point, I'll try to fix that.
